My Semester project

Description
I went into this semester project wanting to make a project that was just mine. So I avoided
looking to much at other students projects or other museum sites.
I also wanted the site to be easy to use and responsive.
This project made me understand so much more of what we’ve learned this first semester.
Putting everything we’ve learned into practice made it so much easier to understand why
things do what they do.
